## Raytracer written in Odin
This is a simple raytracer written in Odin. It is based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley. The book is available for free [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

To run the raytracer, you need to have the Odin compiler installed. You can find the Odin compiler [here](https://odin.handmade.network/). Once you have the compiler installed, you can run the raytracer by running the following command in the terminal:

```
odin run .
```

This will compile the code and run the raytracer. The raytracer will output a .ppm file which you can view using an image viewer.

The raytracer is very simple and only supports spheres and Lambertian materials.
